<h2>Open position:  Postdoctoral Research Scientist</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/">The Shen Lab</a> in the Department of Systems Biology at Columbia University is seeking a talented postdoctoral research scientist with PhD trained in computational genomics or similar areas. The lab is developing new computational methods to analyze large-scale genome sequencing data, and to apply these methods in human disease gene discovery projects. </p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>Postdocs are encouraged to come up with new ideas in the field of computational genomics relevant to the overall theme of the lab. Here are a few examples:
<ul>
<li>	Develop new computational methods to interpret non-protein coding variants in disease context based on molecular mechanisms of gene expression regulation. We have access to large number of whole genome sequencing samples in genetic studies of birth defects and autism. </li>
<li>	Develop new methods to aggregate single cell RNA-seq data and integrate with genetic variations to facilitate discovery of novel disease risk genes and interpretation of biological roles in diseases. </li>
<li>	Dissect post-zygotic somatic mutation patterns in cancer and non-cancer conditions. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>	PhD in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, or equivalent</li>
<li>	Demonstrated experience in high-throughput sequencing data analysis or method development </li>
<li>	Excellent communication skills and teamwork </li>
<li>	Programming: Fluency with at least one general-purpose programming language (such as Python, Swift), and one language/framework for scientific computing (such as R, TensorFlow). Experience with source code version control systems </li>
<li>	Creative thinker and strong problem-solving skills </li>
</ul>
<p>The salary of the position will be competitive based on qualifications.</p>

<p>Applicants should send a <strong>CV</strong>, a <strong>statement of interest</strong>, and <strong>contact information for three references</strong> to <a href="mailto:&#121;&#115;&#50;&#52;&#49;&#49;&#64;&#99;&#117;&#109;&#99;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#109;&#98;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;">Yufeng</a>.
