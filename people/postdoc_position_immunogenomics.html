<h2>Open position:  Postdoctoral Research Scientist</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/">The Shen Lab</a> in Department of Systems Biology at Columbia University is seeking a talented postdoctoral research scientist to develop new computational methods to study clonal dynamics of the immune system. The postdoc will be jointly mentored by <a href="http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/ccti/profile/msykes">Dr. Megan Sykes</a> at The Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. The Sykes and Shen labs have ongoing collaboration to study the mechanism of immune tolerance in organ transplantation using high-throughput genomics and computational approaches.   </p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>The postdoc will lead the analysis in multi-disciplinary collaboration on genomic and translational immunology. Additionally, postdocs are encouraged to come up with new ideas in the field of computational and systems immunology. Here are a few examples:<br />
<ul>
<li>	Develop and apply new computational methods to model T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in health subjects or patients with a range of conditions, such as organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. </li>
<li>	Develop new methods to predict specificity and strength of antigen recognition of TCR sequences. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>	PhD in Computational Biology, Immunology, or equivalent</li>
<li>	Demonstrated experience in high-throughput sequencing data analysis or machine learning </li>
<li>	Excellent communication skills and teamwork </li>
<li>	Programming: Fluency with at least one general-purpose programming language (such as Python, Swift), and one language/framework for scientific computing (such as R, TensorFlow). Experience with source code version control systems </li>
<li>	Creative thinker and strong problem-solving skills </li>
</ul>
<p>The salary of the position will be competitive based on qualifications.</p>

<p>Applicants should send a <strong>CV</strong>, a <strong>statement of interest</strong>, and <strong>contact information for three references</strong> to <a href="mailto:&#121;&#115;&#50;&#52;&#49;&#49;&#64;&#99;&#117;&#109;&#99;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#109;&#98;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;">Yufeng</a>.
